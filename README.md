# IFCO Data Engineering Challenge

This challenge focuses on analyzing and processing order and invoicing data for IFCO using Python and PySpark. It consists of several tasks that involve transforming raw data into useful DataFrames for analyzing key information, such as crate type distribution by company, generating full contact names, and assigning commissions to salespeople. Additionally, thereâ€™s a task to manage sales by company and salespeople.

I completed the challenge by following these steps:

Data Loading: The orders.csv and invoicing_data.json files were imported for further transformation.
Exercises:
Exercise 1: Calculating crate type distribution per company.
Exercise 2: Creating a DataFrame with the full names of contacts.
Exercise 3: Generating a DataFrame with contact addresses.
Exercise 4: Calculating commissions for salespeople based on sales.
Exercise 5: Generating a DataFrame with salespeople per company.
Each task was solved using PySpark, with unit tests validating the correctness and efficiency of the calculations. The solution also includes a clear and documented execution environment for easy reproduction of results.
